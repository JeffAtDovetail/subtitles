00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:01.580
All right.

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:04.369
Name Dwight Schruth. Thank you, Mr. Schnoo.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.980
We will let you know. You have to interview

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.220
me. I just did. The answer to that one question

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.369
told me everything I need to know.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.579
I demand more questions. All right, guys,

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:13.180
good day.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.810
A lot of candidates. Let's discuss.

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.459
OK, if you're not going to interview me, then

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:17.489
I'll do it. Yes.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.299
What will be your first priority?

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:26.850
I will have 7 1st priorities safety, profits,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.229
fostering a community of self-reliance and

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.590
entrepreneurship, listening, respect for

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.220
human life, bolstering our public image and.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:38.439
Getting everyone home on time.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:42.349
Dwight, let me be frank, in an accident that

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:44.069
no one can blame you for, an antique gun

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.459
was discharged while you were acting manager.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.680
How are we ever to trust you again?

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:55.290
That's a great question. I am going to institute

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.880
a strict no firearms policy for this office

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.810
that extends to myself as well. Wow, all

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.089
of my concerns are disappearing. Thank you,

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:06.489
Dwight. Thank you.

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:10.870
You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Shrew,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.410
and I think you're gonna like the call you're

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.930
going to receive. Oh, come on.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.029
I'm just happy that I got this meeting.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:25.739
Wow, that was quick.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.680
Very, very interesting, and you know what?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.650
I'm impressed. He's not a real candidate.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.580
I don't know, Jim, because it makes me think

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.620
about something that my grandfather used

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.180
to say, which is that sometimes the hand

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940
that jumps out of the grave and grabs you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.180
around the throat, that is the hand that

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.169
you want on the wheel. You took the deal.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.339
Yeah, it was a great deal.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.699
That's not OK. I don't know. Dwight seems

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:51.059
like a great leader to me, and I look forward

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:52.660
to the personal perks that he promised me

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.059
privately. What do you think, Tubby?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.330
Well, I could try him out for a little while

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.180
and it doesn't work out, you know. Maybe

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.540
one of us could, you know, step in.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.970
What is happening right now?
